## Data Structure and Data Modeling

I gathered the dataset used from Code Basicsâ€™ website.

The datasets contain Two types of tables -->

**Dimension table:** Static data like customer and product details.

**Fact table:** Transaction data.

* dim_date
* dim_hotels
* dim_rooms
* fact_aggregated_bookings
* fact_bookings

Here is the Datamodel that I have worked on and it's a STAR SCHEMA
